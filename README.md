## Handling Parakeets

ðŸ¦œðŸ¦œðŸ¦œ</br>

#### The project consists of an interactive installation that tells the centrality of the human role in monk parakeets and ring-necked parakeetsâ€™ presence in Italian cities, caused by their importation into the country as pets.

It presents an analysis of the online trading market of these animals, through the selection of listings extracted during the 1st and 5th November 2024, from Facebook, Telegram, Subito.it and other 12 platforms.
From a total of 885 listings, 114 contain photographs where, other than parakeets on sale, human figures are visible through the element of hand.</br>
These listings are grouped into 7 collections based on the ways the hand interacts with the parakeet; they've also been analyzed by comparing the pictures with their descriptions to find out what makes these interactions meaningful. Thus **the hand becomes the symbol of the relationship between people and parakeets**, telling in an emblematic way how these animals are perceived and treated. In the experience, the user will be able to explore these collections and come into contact with the data directly through the movements of their hand.

#### Technical execution

The experience consists of a web application built using _three.js_, an easy-to-use, lightweight Javascript framework built for creating 3D content on a webpage.
Starting from the seven poses, the _Mediapipe Hand Landmark detection algorithm_, a machine-learning solution developed by Google for hand recognition, was used to identify a set of points for each handâ€™s pose.
